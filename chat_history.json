You want to create an educational game where users can input their name and age. The game will then help them pronounce their name correctly and tailor the learning experience based on their age group. Here's a plan to get started:\n\n**Features for the First Version:**\n\n*   **Name Input and Pronunciation:** A screen where users can enter their name. The app will then attempt to pronounce the name and provide feedback to the user.\n*   **Age Input and Grouping:** A screen where users can enter their age. Based on the age, the app will categorize the user into a specific age group (e.g., 5-7, 8-10, 11-13).\n*   **Personalized Learning:** Based on the age group, the app will display appropriate educational content. For the initial version, this could be a simple welcome message tailored to the age group.\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\n*   **Colors:**\n    *   Background: `#F5F5DC` (Beige)\n    *   Text: `#333333` (Dark Gray)\n    *   TextSecondary: `#777777` (Medium Gray)\n    *   Primary: `#4682B4` (Steel Blue)\n    *   Secondary: `#B0E2FF` (Light Blue)\n    *   Accent: `#FFA07A` (Light Salmon)\n    *   Card: `#FFFFFF` (White)\n    *   Highlight: `#FFFFE0` (Light Yellow)\n*   **Typography:** Use a modern, clean font like \"System\" for readability.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Create Input Screens:** Create two new screens, one for name input and another for age input.\n2.  **Implement Name Pronunciation:** Research and integrate a text-to-speech library to pronounce the entered name.\n3.  **Implement Age Grouping:** Add logic to categorize users into age groups based on their input.\n4.  **Personalize Learning:** Modify the home screen to display a welcome message tailored to the user's age group.\n5.  **Navigation:** Connect the input screens to the home screen.\n\nNow, I will instruct the coding agent to implement the plan and modify the app/(tabs) folder to implement the changes and make the changes visible for the user.\n\nAlso, the modalDemos array from app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx should be removed.\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-11-01T18:14:45.002816"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you create an educational game with name input/pronunciation and age-based learning groups.
